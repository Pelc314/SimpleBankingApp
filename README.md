# SimpleBankingApp

This is a part time project in which I developed a simple console ATM simulator in Java.
In this project I explored object oriented programming.

## Example

User Jan Kowalski deposits 100 schmeckles into his bank account and then checks his balance if everything went as expected. After that he checks what operation he executed a couple of seconds earlier because he forgot. His last action is ending the operation and exiting the app/ATM.
